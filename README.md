# Statistics is a scientific approach to analysing numerical data in order to enable us to maximise our interpretation, understanding and use. This means that statistics helps us turn data into information; that is, data that have been interpreted, understood and are useful to the recipient.

Topics to Include
1. Introduction to Statistics
Role of statistics in research
Types of data (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)
Sampling methods and data collection
2. Descriptive Statistics
Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
Measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation)
Data visualization techniques (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)
3. Inferential Statistics
Population vs. sample
Hypothesis testing basics
Parametric tests:
t-tests (one-sample, paired, independent)
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
Post-hoc tests (Tukey, Bonferroni)
Non-parametric tests:
Mann-Whitney U
Kruskal-Wallis
Wilcoxon Signed-Rank
Chi-Square tests (goodness of fit, test of independence)
Correlation and regression analysis (Pearson, Spearman, linear regression)
4. Advanced Statistics
Multivariate statistical techniques (PCA, MANOVA, cluster analysis)
Time series analysis (ARIMA, seasonal decomposition)
Bayesian inference and statistics
Introduction to statistical machine learning
5. Practical Applications
Case studies and examples from:
Agriculture (yield prediction, soil quality)
Climate research (trend analysis, extreme indices)
Medical research (clinical trials, survival analysis)
6. Statistical Tools
Tutorials on using statistical software and programming:
Python (NumPy, pandas, statsmodels, SciPy, seaborn)
R (basic commands, ggplot2, dplyr)
Excel (basic statistics, analysis toolpak)
SPSS (introduction and usage examples)
7. Hands-on Projects
Mini-projects to practice key skills:
Analyzing a dataset from scratch
Performing hypothesis testing
Building a regression model
8. Resources
Glossary of statistical terms
Links to free courses and eBooks
Cheat sheets for Python, R, and Excel
